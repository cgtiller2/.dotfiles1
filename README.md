# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .nanorc
This is my custom .nanorc configuration for Nano.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

# Homework 2
The Scripts add various functions and aliases. The Makefile runs the scripts linux.sh, which creates a .TRASH directory, checks that Linux is running, renames the .nanorc file, and adds a statement to the .bashrc file, and cleanup.sh which undoes those things. The .nanorc file configures the appearance of text, and .bashrc_custom adds the new functions such as the "cdd" command.
